### Summary of College Project: To-Do List Application in C++

**Project Title:** To-Do List Application

**Objective:**
The goal of this project was to develop a console-based to-do list application using C++. This application allows users to manage their tasks efficiently by providing features to add, view, and remove tasks.

**Key Features:**
1. **Task Management:**
   - Users can add new tasks to the list.
   - View all tasks currently in the list with numbering for easy reference.
   - Remove specific tasks by their number.

2. **User Interaction:**
   - A simple menu-driven interface for easy navigation.
   - Input validation to ensure users enter valid options.

3. **Data Structure:**
   - Utilized `std::vector` for dynamic task storage, allowing for seamless addition and removal of tasks.

**Technical Aspects:**
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Development Environment:** Any standard C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Visual Studio)
- **Input Handling:** Used `std::cin` for numeric input and `std::getline` for string input to accommodate task names.

**Implementation Steps:**
1. **Class Definition:** Created a `TodoList` class to encapsulate task management functionalities.
2. **Menu System:** Developed a loop to present a menu of options, allowing users to interact with the application.
3. **Functionality:** Implemented methods for adding, viewing, and removing tasks within the class.

**Challenges Faced:**
- Ensuring proper input validation and error handling.
- Managing dynamic memory with the vector to prevent memory leaks.

**Outcome:**
The project successfully demonstrated how to create a functional to-do list application in C++. It provided hands-on experience with object-oriented programming, data structures, and basic user interface design.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Implementing features like task prioritization, saving tasks to a file, and marking tasks as completed.
- Creating a graphical user interface (GUI) for better user experience.

This project not only met the initial objectives but also laid the groundwork for further improvements and learning in C++ programming.
